abstract = {In the present work, a mass equation obtained as the solution of an inhomogeneous partial difference equation is used to predict masses of unknown neutron-rich and proton-rich nuclei. The inhomogeneous source terms contain shell-dependent symmetry energy expressions (quadratic in isospin), and include, as well, an independently derived shell-model Coulomb energy equation which describes all known Coulomb displacement energies with a standard deviation of σc = 41 keV. Perturbations of higher order in isospin, previously recognized as a cause of systematic effects in long-range mass extrapolations, are also incorporated. The most general solutions of the inhomogeneous difference equation have been deduced from a χ2-minimization procedure based on the recent atomic mass adjustment of Wapstra, Audi, and Hoekstra. Subjecting the solutions further to the condition of charge symmetry preserves the accuracy of Coulomb energies and allows mass predictions for nuclei with both N ⩾ Z and Z > N. The solutions correspond to a mass equation with 470 parameters. Using this equation, 4385 mass values have been calculated for nuclei with A ⩾ 16 (except N = Z = odd for A < 40), with a standard deviation of σm = 194 keV from the experimental masses.}

abstract = {Part A: The transverse Garvey-Kelson mass relation represents a homogeneous third-order partial difference equation. Procedures are described for estimating masses of nuclei with N ⩾ Z from the most general solution of this difference equation subject to a χ2 minimization, using the recent atomic mass adjustment of Wapstra, Audi, and Hoekstra as a boundary condition. A judicious division of the input data into subsets of neutron-rich and proton-rich nuclei had to be introduced to reduce systematic errors in long-range extrapolations. Approximately 5600 mass-excess values for nuclei with 2 ⩽ Z ⩽ 103, 4 ⩽ N ⩽ 157, and N ⩾ Z (except N = Z = odd for A < 40) have been calculated. The standard deviation for reproducing the known mass-excess values is σm ≈ 103 keV. Part B: The charge-symmetric mass relation of Kelson and Garvey for estimating masses of nuclei with Z > N and T ⩾ 1 is described. The calculations make use of the experimental Coulomb energy differences between T = 12 mirror nuclei for A ⩽ 59 and of estimated values for A > 59. Some 250 mass-excess values have been calculated. The standard deviation for reproducing the known values is σm ≈ 231 keV.}

The values of only nine constants are determined directly from a least-squares adjustment to the ground-state masses of 1654 nuclei ranging from 16O to 263106 and to 28 fission-barrier heights. The error of the mass model is 0.669 MeV for the entire region of nuclei considered, but is only 0.448 MeV for the region N ≥ 65.}

The even-odd term is treated more carefully, and a considerable improvement is realized. The shell term is exactly the same as the previous one; it was obtained using spherical single-particle potentials and by treating the deformed nucleus as a superposition of spherical nuclei.

The differential cross sections obtained are analysed with optical potentials whose real parts are derived from the convolution of nuclear-matter distributions with an effective α-nucleon interaction. This interaction is defined both from an analysis of α-scattering from N = Z light nuclei and from heavy nuclei whose matter distributions are supposedly well known. The imaginary parts of the optical potentials are either taken to be proportional to the real parts or to have a Woods-Saxon form. Using parameters for nuclear charge distributions derived from elastic electron scattering, radii of neutron matter distributions with errors varying between ±0.09 fm and ±0.16 fm are extracted for the following nuclei: 12C, 24Mg, 28Si, 32S, 40, 44, 48Ca, 48Ti, 56Fe, 59Co, 58, 60, 62Ni, 68Zn, 88Sr, 89Y, 90, 94Zr, 92Mo, 116, 118, 120, 124Sn, 140Ce 208Pb. The assumptions made in the present analysis and the resulting uncertainties are presented. Charge and neutron radii are compared in isotope and isotone families and to radii determinations from other sources. In particular, our results agree with those derived from proton-scattering analyses and with Hartree-Fock calculations but are not always in accord with the results obtained from Coulomb energy difference methods.}

keywords = {Reaction and interaction cross sections},
abstract = {Background:
In our previous paper, we determined rskin208(exp)=0.278±0.035 fm from measured reaction cross sections σR for p+208Pb scattering, using the Kyushu (chiral) g-matrix folding model with the densities calculated with the Gogny-D1S Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov (D1S-GHFB) with the angular momentum projection (AMP). The value agrees with that of PREX2. Reaction cross sections σR are available for p+48Ca scattering, whereas interaction cross sections σI(≈σR) are available for 48Ca + 12C scattering. As for 48Ca, the high-resolution E1 polarizability experiment (E1pE) yields rskin48(E1pE)=0.14∼0.20fm.
Purpose:
We determine rskin48(exp) from the data on σR for p+48Ca scattering and from the data on σI for 48Ca+12C scattering.
Methods:
We use the Kyushu g-matrix folding model with the densities calculated with the D1M-GHFB+AMP densities. The D1M-GHFB+AMP proton and neutron densities are scaled so as to reproduce the data under the condition that the radius rp of the scaled proton density equals the data rp(exp) determined from the electron scattering. We deduce skin values rskin=rn(exp)−rp(exp) from the resulting rn(exp) and the rp(exp) determined from electron scattering. The same procedure is taken for D1S-GHFB+AMP.
Results:
We regard rskin48(E1pE) as a reference skin value. Using the reference skin value and taking D1M-GHFB+AMP, we determine rskin48(exp)=0.158±0.025 fm for p+48Ca scattering and 0.160±0.058 fm for 48Ca + 12C scattering.
Conclusion:
We take the weighted mean and its error for the two skin values. The result is rskin48(exp)=0.158±(0.023)exp±(0.012)thfm.}

We have used inelastic alpha scattering to excite the giant dipole resonance (GDR). The cross section of this process depends strongly on ΔRnp/R, the relative neutron-skin thickness. We have also measured the excitation of the spin-dipole resonance (SDR) to deduce the neutron-skin thickness since the summed L=1 strength of the SDR is sensitive to it. The results obtained are in good agreement with the previous experimental and theoretical ones.}

journal = {Physica Scripta},
abstract = {The energy of the charge-exchange anti-analogue giant dipole resonance (AGDR) has been calculated for the 208Pb isotope using the state-of-the-art fully self-consistent relativistic proton–neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation based on the relativistic Hartree–Bogoliubov model. It is shown that the AGDR centroid energy is very sensitively related to the corresponding neutron-skin thickness. The neutron-skin thickness of 208Pb has been determined very precisely by comparing the theoretical results with the available experimental data on E(AGDR). The result ΔRpn = 0.161 ± 0.042 agrees nicely with the previous experimental results.}

abstract = {The anti-analog giant dipole resonance (AGDR) was separated from other excitations such as the spin-dipole resonance by multipole decomposition analysis of the \$^\{208\}\{\\rm Pb\}(\\vec \{p\},\\vec \{n\})\$ reaction at a bombarding energy of \$T\_p=296\\,\{\\mathrm \{MeV\}\}\$. The polarization transfer observables were found to be useful for carrying out this separation. The energy difference between the AGDR and the isobaric analog state (IAS) was determined to be ΔE = 8.69 ± 0.36 MeV, where the uncertainty includes both statistical and systematic contributions. Theoretical calculations using the proton-neutron relativistic quasi-particle random phase approximation predicted a strong correlation between \$\\Delta E\$ and the neutron skin thickness \$\\Delta R\_\{pn\}\$. Under the assumption that the correlation predicted in this model is correct, the present \$\\Delta E\$ value corresponds to a neutron skin thickness of \$\\Delta R\_\{pn\}=0.216\\pm 0.046\\pm 0.015\\,\{\\hbox\{fm\}\}\$, where the first and second uncertainties are the experimental and theoretical uncertainties, respectively.},
