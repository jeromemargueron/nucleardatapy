abstract = {Self-consistent mean field models are a powerful tool in the investigation of nuclear structure and low-energy dynamics. They are based on effective energy-density functionals, often formulated in terms of effective density-dependent nucleon–nucleon interactions. The free parameters of the functional are adjusted to empirical data. A proper choice of these parameters requires a comprehensive set of constraints covering experimental data on finite nuclei, concerning static as well as dynamical properties, empirical characteristics of nuclear matter, and observational information on nucleosynthesis, neutron stars and supernovae. This work aims at a comprehensive survey of the performance of one of the most successful non-relativistic self-consistent method, the Skyrme–Hartree–Fock model (SHF), with respect to these constraints. A full description of the Skyrme functional is given and its relation to other effective interactions is discussed. The validity of the application of SHF far from stability and in dense environments beyond the nuclear saturation density is critically assessed. The use of SHF in models extended beyond the mean field approximation by including some correlations, is discussed. Finally, future prospects for further development of SHF towards a more consistent application of the existing and promising newly developing constraints are outlined.}

abstract = {The parameters of the effective Skyrme interaction are determined by requiring that they accurately reproduce the total binding energies and charge radii of magic nuclei in spherical self-consistent calculations. It is shown that many parameter sets can satisfy these requirements. They differ essentially by the single-particle spectra they give. A detailed study of the influence of the force parameters on the binding energies, charge densities, radii and single-particle energies of magic nuclei is made. Extensive self-consistent calculations covering over two hundred nuclei have been performed in a spherical scheme using one of the parameter sets. The effects of pairing correlations are discussed. The magnitude of the corrections due to the deformation in the rare earth region is indicated. The good overall agreement of the results with experimental data shows that the Skyrme parametrisation of the effective interaction is adequate. The remaining discrepancies may be attributed essentially to dynamic collective effects not included in the present approach.}

abstract = {Static nuclear properties associated with a Skyrme-like force in the SkM parametrisation have been extensively studied for both spherical and deformed nuclei through Hartree-Fock plus BCS calculations. These calculations include in particular the determination of the 240Pu fission barrier up to the second saddle point. The validity of some currently used approximations to the Hartree-Fock approach (self-consistent Strutinsky approach, expectation value method and two-step iterative method) has also been assessed. The results of the microscopic calculations have been systematically compared to the corresponding self-consistent results obtained within the extended Thomas-Fermi framework. Such semiclassical calculations also allow a proper characterisation of the SkM force surface properties (in the liquid drop or droplet model sense). Whereas ground-state radii and multipole moments are found in excellent agreement with experimental data, binding energies are systematically too high and fission barriers are significantly too low. These two defects are shown to be correlated through the too low surface tension of the force. A modified parametrisation is discussed which heals both these defects while keeping intact the good reproduction of other properties. This constitutes a first step in the direction of current efforts to determine a better parametrisation of Skyrme-like forces.}

For this purpose, a set of trial Skyrme forces, which are constrained by a fit to nuclear radii and binding energies, is developed. This leaves six free parameters: the spin-orbit strength, the nuclear-matter compression modulus, the isoscalar and isovector contributions to the effective masses, the value of the exchange parameter x3 (governing the surface-symmetry properties) and the coefficient of the “gradient-symmetry” term |▽ρn − ▽ρp|2 in the energy-density functional. The influence of these parameters on various properties is studied: droplet-model parameters, quality of the fit to experimental masses, extrapolation of masses, fit to charge radii, charge distributions and neutron-skin thicknesses, semiclassical fission barriers, and Landau parameters. Indications are given of the directions which could be followed in order to improve the fit to experimental data. Several correlations remaining in the results suggest that a larger number of degrees of freedom obtained by additional terms could be useful.}

We discuss and unravel the causes of correlations among the neutron skin thickness in heavy nuclei, the pressure of beta-equilibrated matter at a density of 0.1fm-3, the derivative of the nuclear symmetry energy at the same density and the radii of moderate mass neutron stars. Constraints on the symmetry properties of nuclear matter from the binding energies of nuclei are examined. The extent to which forthcoming neutron skin measurements will further delimit the symmetry properties is investigated. The impact of symmetry energy constraints for the mass and moment of inertia contained within neutron star crusts and the threshold density for the nucleon direct Urca process, all of which are potentially measurable, is explored. We also comment on the minimum neutron star radius, assuming that only nucleonic matter exists within the star.}

We retain the earlier constraints on the Skyrme force of reproducing the energy-density curve of neutron matter, and of having an isoscalar effective mass of 0.8M in symmetric infinite nuclear matter at the saturation density; we also keep the recently adopted device of dropping Coulomb exchange. Furthermore, the correction term for the spurious energy of collective motion has a form that is known to favour fission barriers that are in good agreement with experiment. Despite the extra constraints on the effective force, we have achieved a better fit to the mass data than any other mean field model, the rms error on the 2149 measured masses of nuclei with N and Z⩾ 8 having been reduced to 0.632 MeV; the improvement is particularly striking for the most neutron-rich nuclei. Moreover, it turns out that even with no flexibility at all remaining for the pairing force, the spectral pairing gaps that we find suggest that level densities in good agreement with experiment should be obtained. This new force is thus particularly well-suited for astrophysical applications, such as stellar nucleosynthesis and neutron-star crusts.}

Calculations of nuclear matter and finite nuclei in both renormalizable and nonrenormalizable, effective QHD models are discussed. Connections are made between the effective and renormalizable models, as well as between relativistic mean-field theory and more sophisticated treatments. Recent work in QHD involving nuclear structure, electroweak interactions in nuclei, relativistic transport theory, nuclear matter under extreme conditions, and the evaluation of loop diagrams is reviewed. }

abstract = {The role of the isovector rho-meson coupling on the symmetry energy in the relativistic mean-field theory has been investigated. In a multi-dimensional parameter search for an appropriate force within the framework of the non-linear σωϱ model the ϱ-meson coupling has been found to have a significant effect on the neutron skin of nuclei. It has been shown that a low value of ϱ-meson coupling strength remedies the defect of some of the existing parameter sets of providing a higher neutron skin thickness of nuclei. An extraordinarily good description of highly proton- as well as neutron-rich exotic nuclei has been found. It has been observed that the proper description of both proton-rich and neutron-rich nuclei is sensitive to the symmetry energy.}

The lagrangian of the RMF theory is motivated by the recent success of the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory. The parameters in the lagrangian are determined by the properties of nuclei including unstable ones and provide the equation of state of nuclear matter similar to the one in the RBHF theory. The proton fraction in neutron-star matter is found to be large enough to allow the direct URCA process for rapid cooling of neutron stars. We calculate nuclear matter having arbitrary proton fractions at finite temperature to provide the equation of state for studies of supernova explosions. The properties of supernova matter containing abundant leptons are studied in detail and the consequences on the gravitational mass of hot neutron stars at the birth era are discussed.}

abstract = {Nuclear matter and ground state properties for (proton and neutron) semi-closed shell nuclei are described in relativistic mean field theory with coupling constants which depend on the vector density. The parametrization of the density dependence for σ-, ω- and ρ-meson coupling is obtained by fitting to properties of nuclear matter and some finite nuclei. The results are compared to density-dependent coupling constants derived from self-energies of Dirac-Brueckner calculations of nuclear matter. The equation of state for symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter is discussed. Finite nuclei are described in Hartree approximation, including a charge and a centre-of-mass correction. Pairing is considered in the BCS approximation. Special attention is directed to the predictions for properties at the neutron and proton driplines.}

abstract = {The evolution of nuclear shell structure is investigated for the first time within density-dependent relativistic Hartree-Fock theory and the role of π-exchange potential is studied in detail. The energy differences between the neutron orbits {ν1h9/2, ν1i13/2} in the N=82 isotones and between the proton ones {π1g7/2, π1h11/2} in the Z=50 isotopes are extracted as a function of neutron excess N- Z. A kink around Z=58 for the N=82 isotones is found as an effect of pion correlations. It is shown that the inclusion of π-coupling plays a central role to provide substantial isospin dependence of the energy differences. In particular, the tensor part of the π-coupling has an important effect on the characteristic isospin dependence observed in recent experiments.}
