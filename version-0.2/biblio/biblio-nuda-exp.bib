abstract = {This paper is the second part of the new evaluation of atomic masses Ame2003. From the results of a least-squares calculation described in Part I for all accepted experimental data, we derive here tables and graphs to replace those of 1993. The first table lists atomic masses. It is followed by a table of the influences of data on primary nuclides, a table of separation energies and reaction energies, and finally, a series of graphs of separation and decay energies. The last section in this paper lists all references to the input data used in Part I of this Ame2003 and also to the data entering the Nubase2003 evaluation (first paper in this volume).

abstract = {This paper is the first of two articles (Part I and Part II) that presents the results of the new atomic mass evaluation, Ame2012. It includes complete information on the experimental input data (including not used and rejected ones), as well as details on the evaluation procedures used to derive the tables with recommended values given in the second part. This article describes the evaluation philosophy and procedures that were implemented in the selection of specific nuclear reaction, decay and mass-spectrometer results. These input values were entered in the least-squares adjustment procedure for determining the best values for the atomic masses and their uncertainties. Calculation procedures and particularities of the Ame are then described. All accepted and rejected data, including outweighed ones, are presented in a tabular format and compared with the adjusted values (obtained using the adjustment procedure). Differences with the previous Ame2003 evaluation are also discussed and specific information is presented for several cases that may be of interest to various Ame users. The second Ame2012 article, the last one in this issue, gives a table with recommended values of atomic masses, as well as tables and graphs of derived quantities, along with the list of references used in both this Ame2012 evaluation and the Nubase2012 one (the first paper in this issue).}

journal = {Chinese Physics C},
abstract = {This paper presents the NUBASE2016 evaluation that contains the recommended values for nuclear and decay properties of 3437 nuclides in their ground and excited isomeric (T1/2 ⩾ 100 ns) states. All nuclides for which any experimental information is known were considered. NUBASE2016 covers all data published by October 2016 in primary (journal articles) and secondary (mainly laboratory reports and conference proceedings) references, together with the corresponding bibliographical information. During the development of NUBASE2016, the data available in the ‘Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File’ (ENSDF) database were consulted and critically assessed for their validity and completeness. Furthermore, a large amount of new data and some older experimental results that were missing from ENSDF were compiled, evaluated and included in NUBASE2016. The atomic mass values were taken from the ‘Atomic Mass Evaluation’ (AME2016, second and third parts of the present issue). In cases where no experimental data were available for a particular nuclide, trends in the behavior of specific properties in neighboring nuclides (TNN) were examined. This approach allowed to estimate values for a range of properties that are labeled in NUBASE2016 as ‘non-experimental’ (flagged ‘#’). Evaluation procedures and policies used during the development of this database are presented, together with a detailed table of recommended values and their uncertainties.

author = {P. Vogel and B. Jonson and P.G. Hansen},
abstract = {Present knowledge of the proton and neutron pairing energies Δp and Δn, deduced from nuclear masses, is reviewed and an attempt is made to find general trends in the data. The analysis shows that, besides the well-known smooth slow decrease with A, the pairing energies also contain a symmetry energy-like dependence on the neutron excess (N−Z)A. The trends is most pronounced in the shell 50<Z<82, 82<N<126 where both pairing energies decrease by a factor of almost two between the most neutron deficient and the most neutron rich nuclei. The same tendency persists in other mass regions, but is not a universal one. An empirical expression for Δ, that is more accurate than the value 12A−12 MeV usually assumed, is proposed.}

abstract = {The present table contains experimental root-mean-square (rms) nuclear charge radii R obtained by combined analysis of two types of experimental data: (i) radii changes determined from optical and, to a lesser extent, Kα X-ray isotope shifts and (ii) absolute radii measured by muonic spectra and electronic scattering experiments. The table combines the results of two working groups, using respectively two different methods of evaluation, published in ADNDT earlier. It presents an updated set of rms charge radii for 909 isotopes of 92 elements from 1H to 96Cm together, when available, with the radii changes from optical isotope shifts. Compared with the last published tables of R-values from 2004 (799 ground states), many new data are added due to progress recently achieved by laser spectroscopy up to early 2011. The radii changes in isotopic chains for He, Li, Be, Ne, Sc, Mn, Y, Nb, Bi have been first obtained in the last years and several isotopic sequences have been recently extended to regions far off stability, (e.g., Ar, Mo, Sn, Te, Pb, Po).}

abstract = {The compression-mode giant resonances, namely the isoscalar giant monopole and isoscalar giant dipole modes, are examples of collective nuclear motion. Their main interest stems from the fact that one hopes to extrapolate from their properties the incompressibility of uniform nuclear matter, which is a key parameter of the nuclear Equation of State (EoS). Our understanding of these issues has undergone two major jumps, one in the late 1970s when the Isoscalar Giant Monopole Resonance (ISGMR) was experimentally identified, and another around the turn of the millennium since when theory has been able to start giving reliable error bars to the incompressibility. However, mainly magic nuclei have been involved in the deduction of the incompressibility from the vibrations of finite nuclei. The present review deals with the developments beyond all this. Experimental techniques have been improved, and new open-shell, and deformed, nuclei have been investigated. The associated changes in our understanding of the problem of the nuclear incompressibility are discussed. New theoretical models, decay measurements, and the search for the evolution of compressional modes in exotic nuclei are also discussed.}
