# How to contribute?

Please reach out us at our [email](mailto:nucleardatapy@gmail.com) and let us know how you would like to contribute.

Once the toolkit is released, the rules to contribute will be changing. A team of developers will be defined and a generic email to contact them should be created. Here is a suggestion to contribute after the release.

This file describes how new contributors to the project can start contributing.

## Two ways

You can provide your data by interacting with one of our developers or co-authors.

You can also join the development team and extend the functionality of this toolkit.

### Provide your data

Please contact the developer team directly by shooting an email to [nucleardatapy@gmail.com](mailto:nucleardatapy@gmail.com)

Then you can interact directly with one of our developers and provide your data. You will not be able to push your data to the repository, but an updated version of the toolkit will contain your new data.

### Join the team

Please contact the developer team directly by shooting an email to [nucleardatapy@gmail.com](mailto:nucleardatapy@gmail.com). Explain the reason why you wish to join the team and if you have ideas about extending the functionality of the toolkit.

Once in the team, a branch will be dedicated to your contribution. You could show it during our virtual meetings, and your contribution will be merged to the new version of the toolkit.
