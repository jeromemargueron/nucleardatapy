# nucleardatapy

This python toolkit is designed to provide 1) microscopic calculations
in nuclear matter, 2) phenomenological predictions in nuclear matter,
and 3) experimental data for finite nuclei.

Install the toolkit:

$ bash install.sh

Create an environement variable that will be used by python:

export NUCLEARDATAPY_TK=/path/to/nucdatapy-tk

put this command in your .profile or .zprofile or .bashrc for instance.

Now everything is done about the compilation. You can come back to the
python folder.

# Use nucleardatapy python toolkit

Go to the folder mylib/nucleardatapy/samples/nucleardatapy_samples/ and try that:

$ python3 sample_SetupMicro.py

# Test the python toolkit

A set of tests can be easily performed. They are stored in tests/ folder.

Launch:

$ bash run_tests.bash
