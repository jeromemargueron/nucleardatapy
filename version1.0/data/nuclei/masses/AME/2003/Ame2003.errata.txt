  76Se   (see AMDC newsletter May 2004: 76Se from SMILETRAP   DRAFT-29-apr-2004

         In the process of the mass evaluation, the evaluator must
         always be carefull to use only the primary information.
         While doing this, unfortunately, an accident occurred in the
         Ame2003 for the publication of 2001Do08.
         In this paper three results were given for 76Ge, 76Se and for
         their difference (of higher precision, due to drastically
         reduced systematic uncertainties in their combination).
         We should have used the 76Se and the 76Ge-76Se result and
         not the 76Ge in order not to use twice the same info.
         Unfortunately, in the process we accidentaly dropped also 76Se.

         Using this 76Se result will give, as expected, improved
         values in both 76Se and 76Ge mass-excesses:
             76 Ge = -73212.863 (0.091) keV
             76 Se = -75251.866 (0.075) keV
         We apologize for any resulting inconveniency for the user,
         and to the Smiletrap team who has done a wonderful work.

  PAIRING ENERGIES (cf. bulletin amdc.061 of January 2006)

    In Ame'93 and Ame2003 we calculated pairing energies in tables
    available from the AMDC web (not published material):
    http://amdc.in2p3.fr/masstables/Ame1993/rct3_rmd.mas93
    http://amdc.in2p3.fr/masstables/Ame2003/rct7.mas03
    The quantities Dnn and Dpp are the neutron and proton pairing
    energies as defined in Ame'83, p.56.
    Unfortunately, the values given for the neutron-proton pairing
    energies (written Dnp in Ame'93, Pa in Ame2003) in these files do
    not correspond to the definition in Ame'83, p.56, but to an older
    definition which used only 2 Sd (deuton separation energies):
    1/2(-1)**(Z)[-Sd(A+2,Z+1)+Sd(A,Z)]
    instead of 3:
    1/4(-1)**(Z+1)[Sd(A+2,Z+1)-2Sd(A,Z)+Sd(A-2,Z-1)]
    Although the formula with 2 Sd is still correct, we believe the
    formula with 3 Sd to be better.
    We kindly ask those to used these np-pairing to accept our
    apologize, and be informed that the physics they derived from
    them is essentially unchanged.
    We thank Pr. Till von Egidy for pointing out the problem.
