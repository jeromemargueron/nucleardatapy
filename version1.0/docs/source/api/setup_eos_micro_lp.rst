Here are a set of figures which are produced with the Python sample: /sample/nucleardatapy_plots/plot_setupeosmicroLP.py

.. figure:: ../../../samples/nucleardatapy_plots/figs/plot_SetupEOSMicroLP0_SM.png
	:scale: 70 %
	:alt: map to buried treasure

	This figure shows the L=0 Landau parameters in SM for different NN interactions obtained
	from BHF calculations.
