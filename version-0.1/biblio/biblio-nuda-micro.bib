abstract = {We report variational calculations of the equation of state of hot and cold, nuclear and neutron matter. The calculations cover a wide density range of interest in heavy-ion collisions and astrophysics. The “hot” calculations are limited to temperatures less than 20 MeV. A realistic nuclear hamiltonian that contains two- and three-nucleon interactions and fits the nucléon-nucléon scattering, as well as nuclear matter data, is used. Neutron star structure calculations are reported and their sensitivity to the three-neutron interactipn is examined. The liquid-vapor phase equilibrium, as well as the behavior of the effective mass in nuclear matter is discussed.}

abstract = {S-wave pairing in neutron matter is studied within an extension of correlated basis function (CBF) theory to include the strong, short range spatial correlations due to realistic nuclear forces and the pairing correlations of the Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) approach. The correlation operator contains central as well as tensor components. The correlated BCS scheme of [S. Fantoni, Nucl. Phys. A 363 (1981) 381], developed for simple scalar correlations, is generalized to this more realistic case. The energy of the correlated pair condensed phase of neutron matter is evaluated at the two-body order of the cluster expansion, but considering the one-body density and the corresponding energy vertex corrections at the first order of the Power Series expansion. Based on these approximations, we have derived a system of Euler equations for the correlation factors and for the BCS amplitudes, resulting in correlated nonlinear gap equations, formally close to the standard BCS ones. These equations have been solved for the momentum independent part of several realistic potentials (Reid, Argonne v14 and Argonne v8′) to stress the role of the tensor correlations and of the many-body effects. Simple Jastrow correlations and/or the lack of the density corrections enhance the gap with respect to uncorrelated BCS, whereas it is reduced according to the strength of the tensor interaction and following the inclusion of many-body contributions.}
